# Fishing Mod
Note: This mod is currently work in progress. I'll be adding more content to it. 

This mod allows the player to fish at Del Perro Pier, or on any boat! You can sell the fish you've caught as well. Currently there are 20 types of fish and 31 secret items for you to catch!

##REQUIREMENTS:
1. [ScriptHookV](http://gtaforums.com/topic/788343-vrel-script-hook-v/)
2. [ScriptHookV DotNet](http://gtaforums.com/topic/789907-vrel-community-script-hook-v-net)

##INSTALLATION:
1. Put "Fishing.cs" and "Fishing.ini" in "scripts" folder. Create "scripts" folder if it does not exist. 
2. Open "Fishing.ini" and change the keybind for fishing if F5 is already bound to other scripts. 

##HOW TO PLAY:
1. Go to the fishing location (shown in the screenshot) OR get in a boat! 
2. Press the fishing key to fish (default F5 for keyboard, LS for controller, editable) 
3. Sell the fish you've caught at the location shown in the screenshot (by pressing the same fishing button) 

##CHANGELOG:
- v0.2: Better entity spawn with physics. Added more fish and fun items. 
- v0.2.1: Added actual fish models. 
- v0.2.2: Fixed prop being stuck (sort of). Added more fish and items.
