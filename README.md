# GTAVMod_Fishing
Note: This mod is currently in development. There isn't much content at the moment. I'll be adding more stuff to it.

This mod allows the player to fish at Del Perro Pier. You can sell the fish you've caught as well. Currently there are 17 types of fish and 25 secret items for you to catch!

##INSTALLATION:
1. Put "Fishing.cs" and "Fishing.ini" in "scripts" folder. Create "scripts" folder if it does not exist.
